A simple to do list.

Change log:
-adding tasks
-marking them done
-filter to do / doing tasks (spent an hour looking at this problem, needed to only change one letter of code)
-map enter key to add task

To be added:
-no tasks alerts
-highlight active filter (css)
-add number of todo items
-add X to delete tasks
-make it look a bit better because it looks like something from 2002
