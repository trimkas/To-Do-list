# A simple to do list.


Change log:
* adding tasks
* marking them done
* filter to do / doing tasks (spent an hour looking at this problem, needed to only change one letter of code)
* map enter key to add task
* add number of todo items
* no tasks alerts
* add X to delete tasks




To be added:
* highlight active filter button (css)
* use popups instead of alerts (alerts are very annoying)
